</div>

<p class='c005'>The Trustees of the John F. Slater Fund propose to publish from time to
time papers that relate to the education of the colored race. These papers
are designed to furnish information to those who are concerned in the administration
of schools, and also to those who by their official stations are
called upon to act or to advise in respect to the care of such institutions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Trustees believe that the experimental period in the education of
the blacks is drawing to a close. Certain principles that were doubted thirty
years ago now appear to be generally recognized as sound. In the next
thirty years better systems will undoubtedly prevail, and the aid of the
separate States is likely to be more and more freely bestowed. There will
also be abundant room for continued generosity on the part of individuals
and associations. It is to encourage and assist the workers and the thinkers
that these papers will be published.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each paper, excepting the first number (made up chiefly of official documents),
will be the utterance of the writer whose name is attached to it,
the Trustees disclaiming in advance all responsibility for the statement of
facts and opinions.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Introduction.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>The purpose of this paper is to put into permanent form a
narrative of what has been done at the South for the education
of the negro since 1860. The historical and statistical
details may seem dry and uninteresting, but we can understand
the significance of this unprecedented educational movement
only by a study of its beginnings and of the difficulties
which had to be overcome. The present generation, near as
it is to the genesis of the work, cannot appreciate its magnitude,
nor the greatness of the victory which has been achieved,
without a knowledge of the facts which this recital gives in
connected order. The knowledge is needful, also, for a comprehension
of the future possible scope and kind of education
to be given to the Afro-American race. In the field of education
we shall be unwise not to reckon with such forces as
custom, physical constitution, heredity, racial characteristics
and possibilities, and not to remember that these and other
causes may determine the limitations under which we must
act. The education of this people has a far-reaching and
complicated connection with their destiny, with our institutions,
and possibly with the Dark Continent, which may
assume an importance akin, if not superior, to what it had
centuries ago. The partition of its territory, the international
questions which are springing up, and the effect of contact
with and government by a superior race, must necessarily give
an enhanced importance to Africa as a factor in commerce, in
relations of governments, and in civilization. England will
soon have an unbroken line of territorial possessions from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope. Germany, France, Portugal,
Italy, Spain, possibly Russia, will soon have such footholds
in Africa as, whatever else may occur, will tend to the
development of century-paralyzed resources.</p>

<p class='c006'>What other superior races have done, and are doing, for
the government and uplifting of the inferior races, which,
from treaty or conquest, have been placed under their responsible
jurisdiction, may help in the solution of our problem.
Italy had a grand question in its unification; Prussia a graver
one in the nationalization of Germany, taxing the statesmanship
of Stein, Bismarck, and their co-laborers; Great Britain,
in the administration of her large and widely remote colonial
dependencies with their different races; but our problem has
peculiar difficulties which have not confronted other governments,
and therefore demands the best powers of philanthropist,
sociologist, and statesman.</p>

<p class='c006'>The emergence of a nation from barbarism to a general
diffusion of intelligence and property, to health in the social
and civil relations; the development of an inferior race into
a high degree of enlightenment; the overthrow of customs
and institutions which, however indefensible, have their seat
in tradition and a course of long observance; the working out
satisfactorily of political, sociological, and ethical problems—are
all necessarily slow, requiring patient and intelligent study
of the teachings of history and the careful application of
something more than mere empirical methods. Civilization,
freedom, a pure religion, are not the speedy outcome of revolutions
and cataclysms any more than has been the structure
of the earth. They are the slow evolution of orderly and
creative causes, the result of law and preordained principles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The educational work described in this paper has been most
valuable, but it has been so far necessarily tentative and local.
It has lacked broad and definite generalization, and, in all its
phases, comprehensive, philosophical consideration. As auxiliary
to a thorough study and ultimate better plans, the Slater
Fund, from time to time, will have prepared and published
papers bearing on different phases of the negro question.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>I. The history of the negro on this continent is full of
pathetic and tragic romance, and of startling, unparalleled
incident. The seizure in Africa, the forcible abduction and
cruel exportation, the coercive enslavement, the subjection to
environments which emasculate a race of all noble aspirations
and doom inevitably to hopeless ignorance and inferiority,
living in the midst of enlightenments and noblest civilization
and yet forbidden to enjoy the benefits of which others were
partakers, for four years amid battle and yet, for the most
part, having no personal share in the conflict, by statute and
organic law and law of nations held in fetters and inequality,
and then, in the twinkling of an eye, lifted from bondage to
freedom, from slavery to citizenship, from dependence on
others and guardianship to suffrage and eligibility to office—can
be predicated of no other race. Other peoples, after long
and weary years of discipline and struggle, against heaviest
odds, have won liberty and free government. This race,
almost without lifting a hand, unappreciative of the boon
except in the lowest aspects of it, and unprepared for privileges
and responsibilities, has been lifted to a plane of citizenship
and freedom, such as is enjoyed, in an equal degree, by
no people in the world outside of the United States.</p>

<p class='c006'>Common schools in all governments have been a slow
growth, reluctantly conceded, grudgingly supported, and perfected
after many experiments and failures and with heavy
pecuniary cost. Within a few years after emancipation, free
and universal education has been provided for the negro,
without cost to himself, and chiefly by the self-imposed taxes
of those who, a few years before, claimed his labor and time
without direct wage or pecuniary compensation.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. Slavery, recognized by the then international law and
the connivance and patronage of European sovereigns, existed
in all the colonies prior to the Declaration of Independence,
and was reinforced by importation of negroes from Africa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in foreign and New England and New York vessels. In
course of time it was confined to the Southern States, and
the negroes increased in numbers at a more rapid rate than
did the whites, even after the slave trade was abolished and
declared piracy.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a long time there was no general exclusion by law of
the slaves from the privileges of education. The first prohibitory
and punitive laws were directed against unlawful
assemblages of negroes, and subsequently of free negroes and
mulattoes, as their influence in exciting discontent or insurrection
was deprecated and guarded against. Afterwards,
legislation became more general in the South, prohibiting
meetings for teaching reading and writing. The Nat Turner
insurrection in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831,
awakened the Southern States to a consciousness of the perils,
which might environ or destroy them, from combinations of
excited, inflamed, and ill-advised negroes.</p>

<p class='c006'>As documents and newspapers tending to inflame discontent
and insurrection were supposed to have been the immediate
provocation to this conspiracy for murder of whites and for
freedom of the blacks, laws were passed against publishing
and circulating such documents among the colored population,
and strengthening the prohibitions and penalties against
education.</p>

<p class='c006'>Severe and general as were these laws, they rarely applied,
and were seldom, if ever, enforced, against teaching of individuals
or of groups on plantations, or at the homes of the
owners. It was often true that the mistress of a household,
or her children, would teach the house servants, and on Sundays
include a larger number. There were also Sunday
Schools in which black children were taught to read, notably
the school in which Stonewall Jackson was a leader. It is
pleasant to find recorded in the memoir of Dr. Boyce, a
Trustee of this Fund from its origin until his death, that, as
an editor, a preacher, and a citizen, he was deeply interested
in the moral and religious instruction of the negroes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>After a most liberal estimate for the efforts made to teach the
negroes, still the fact exists that, as a people, they were wholly
uneducated in schools. Slavery doomed the millions to ignorance,
and in this condition they were when the war began.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. Almost synchronously with the earliest occupation of
any portion of the seceding States by the Union Army, efforts
were begun to give the negroes some schooling. In September,
1861, under the guns of Fortress Monroe, a school was
opened for the “contrabands of war.” In 1862, schools were
extended to Washington, Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Newport
News, and afterwards to the Port Royal islands on the coast
of South Carolina, to Newbern and Roanoke Island in North
Carolina. The proclamation of emancipation, January 1,
1863, gave freedom to all slaves reached by the armies, increased
the refugees, and awakened a fervor of religious and
philanthropic enthusiasm for meeting the physical, moral, and
intellectual wants of those suddenly thrown upon charity. In
October, 1863, General Banks, then commanding the Department
of the Gulf, created commissioners of enrollment, who
established the first public schools for Louisiana. Seven were
soon in operation, with twenty-three teachers and an average
attendance of 1422 scholars. On March 22, 1864, he issued
General Order, No. 38, which constituted a Board of Education
“for the rudimental instruction of the freedmen” in the
Department, so as to “place within their reach the elements
of knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Board was ordered to establish common schools, to
employ teachers, to acquire school sites, to erect school buildings
where no proper or available ones for school purposes
existed, to purchase and provide necessary books, stationery,
apparatus, and a well selected library, to regulate the course
of studies, and “to have the authority and perform the same
duties that assessors, supervisors, and trustees had in the
Northern States in the matter of establishing and conducting
common schools.” For the performance of the duties enjoined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the Board was empowered to “assess and levy a school tax
upon real and personal property, including crops of plantations.”
These taxes were to be sufficient to defray expense
and cost of establishing, furnishing, and conducting the schools
for the period of one year. When the tax list and schedules
should be placed in the hands of the Parish Provost Marshal,
he was to collect and pay over within thirty days to the School
Board. Schools previously established were transferred to
this Board; others were opened, and in December, 1864, they
reported under their supervision 95 schools, 162 teachers, and
9,571 scholars. This system continued until December, 1865,
when the power to levy the tax was suspended. An official
report of later date says: “In this sad juncture the freedmen
expressed a willingness to endure and even petitioned for
increased taxation in order that means for supporting their
schools might be obtained.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On December 17, 1862, Col. John Eaton was ordered by
General Grant to assume a general supervision of freedmen in
the Department of Tennessee and Arkansas. In the early
autumn of that year schools had been established, and they
were multiplied during 1863 and 1864. In the absence of
responsibility and supervision there grew up abuses and complaints.
By some “parties engaged in the work” of education,
“exorbitant charges were made for tuition,” and agents
and teachers, “instead of making common cause for the good
of those they came to benefit, set about detracting, perplexing,
and vexing each other.” “Parties and conflicts had arisen.”
“Frauds had appeared in not a few instances—evil minded,
irresponsible, or incompetent persons imposing upon those not
prepared to defeat or check them.” “Bad faith to fair promises
had deprived the colored people of their just dues.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. See report of Chaplain Warren, 1864, relating to colored schools.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On September 26, 1864, the Secretary of War, through
Adjutant General Thomas, issued Order No. 28, in which he
said: “To prevent confusion and embarrassment, the General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Superintendent of Freedmen will designate officers, subject to
his orders, as Superintendents of colored schools, through
whom he will arrange the location of all schools, teachers,
occupation of houses, and other details pertaining to the
education of the freedmen.” In accordance with this order,
Col. Eaton removed his headquarters from Vicksburg to
Memphis. On October 20, 1864, he issued sixteen rules
and regulations for the guidance of superintendents and
teachers of colored schools in his supervision. These instructions
to subordinates were wise and provided for the opening
of a sufficient number of schools, for the payment of
tuition fees from 25 cents to $1.25 per month for each scholar,
according to the ability of the parents; for the admission free
of those who could not pay and the furnishing of clothing by
the aid of industrial schools, for the government of teachers
in connection with the societies needing them, &amp;c. The
“industrial schools” were schools in which sewing was taught,
and in which a large quantity of the clothing and material
sent from the North was made over or made up for freedmen’s
use, and were highly “useful in promoting industrious habits
and in teaching useful arts of housewifery.” The supervision
under such a competent head caused great improvement in the
work, but department efforts were hindered by some representatives
of the benevolent societies who did not heartily
welcome the more orderly military supervision. An Assistant
Superintendent, March 31, 1865, reports, in and around
Vicksburg and Natchez, 30 schools, 60 teachers, and 4,393
pupils enrolled; in Memphis, 1,590 pupils, and in the entire
supervision, 7,360 in attendance.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Eaton submitted a report of his laborious work
which is full of valuable information. Naturally, some abatement
must be made from conclusions which were based on the
wild statements of excited freedmen, or the false statements of
interested persons. “Instinct of unlettered reason” caused a
hegira of the blacks to camps of the Union Army, or within
protected territory. The “negro population floated or was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>kicked about at will.” Strict supervision became urgent to
secure “contraband information” and service, and protect the
ignorant, deluded people from unscrupulous harpies. “Mental
and moral enlightenment” was to be striven for, even in
those troublous times, and it was fortunate that so capable and
faithful an officer as General Eaton was in authority.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the operations of the supervisors of schools did not give
satisfaction, for the Inspector of Schools in South Carolina
and Georgia, on October 13, 1865, says: “The Bureau does
not receive that aid from the Government and Government
officials it had a right to expect, and really from the course
of the military officials in this Department, you might think
that the only enemies to the Government are the agents of
the Bureau.”</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. By act of Congress of March 3, 1865, the Freedmen’s
Bureau was created. The scope of its jurisdiction and work
extended far beyond education. It embraced abandoned lands
and the supply of the negroes with food and clothing, and during
1865 as many as 148,000 were reported as receiving rations.
The Quartermaster and Commissary Departments were placed
at the service of the agents of the Bureau, and, in addition to
freedom, largesses were lavishly given to “reach the great
and imperative necessities of the situation.” Large and comprehensive
powers and resources were placed in the hands of
the Bureau, and limitations of the authority of the Government
were disregarded in order to meet the gravest problem of
the century. Millions of recently enslaved negroes, homeless,
penniless, ignorant, were to be saved from destitution or
perishing, to be prepared for the sudden boon of political
equality, to be made self-supporting citizens and to prevent
their freedom from becoming a curse to themselves and their
liberators. The Commissioner was authorized “to seize, hold,
use, lease, or sell all buildings and tenements and any lands
appertaining to the same, or otherwise formally held, under
color of title by the late Confederate States, and buildings or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>lands held in trust for the same, and to use the same, or
appropriate the proceeds derived therefrom, to the education
of the freed people.” He was empowered also to “coöperate
with private benevolent associations in aid of the freedmen.”
The Bureau was attached to the War Department and was at
first limited in duration to one year, but was afterwards prolonged.
General O. O. Howard was appointed Commissioner,
with assistants. He says he was invested with “almost unlimited
authority” and that the act and orders gave “great
scope and liberty of action.” “Legislative, judicial, and
executive powers were combined, reaching all the interests
of the freedmen.” On June 2, 1865, the President ordered
all officers of the United States to turn over to the Bureau
“all property, funds, lands, and records in any way connected
with freedmen and refugees.” This bestowment of despotic
power was not considered unwise because of the peculiar
exigencies of the times and the condition of the freedmen,
who, being suddenly emancipated by a dynamic process, were
without schools, or teachers, or means to procure them. To
organize the work, a Superintendent of Schools was appointed
for each State. Besides the regular appropriation by
Congress, the Military authorities aided the Bureau. Transportation
was furnished to teachers, books, and school furniture,
and material aid was given to all engaged in education.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Howard used his large powers to get into his
custody the funds scattered in the hands of many officers,
which could be made available for the freedmen. Funds
bearing different names were contributed to the work of
“colored education.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a> During the war some of the States
sent money, to officers serving in the South, to buy substitutes
from among the colored people to fill up their quota
under the draft. A portion of the bounty money thus
sent, by an order of Gen. B. F. Butler, August 4, 1864,
was retained in the hands of officers who had been superintendents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of negro affairs, and by the President’s order of
June 2, 1865 was turned over to the disbursing officers of
the Bureau of Freedmen. After the organization of the
Bureau, Gen. Howard instructed agents to turn money,
held by them, over to the chief disbursing officer of the
Bureau. This was in no sense public money, but belonged
to individuals, enlisted as contraband recruits to fill the
State quotas. What was unclaimed of what was held in
trust under Gen. Butler’s order was used for educational
purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the early part of 1867, the accounting officers of the
Treasury Department ascertained that numerous frauds were
being perpetrated on colored claimants for bounties under acts
of Congress. Advising with General Howard, the Treasury
officials drew a bill, which Congress enacted into a law,
devolving upon the Commissioner the payment of bounties to
colored soldiers and sailors. This enlarged responsibility gave
much labor to General Howard, in his already multifarious
and difficult duties, and made more honorable the acquittal
which he secured when an official investigation was subsequently
ordered upon his administration of the affairs of the
Bureau.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Act of Congress of July 16, 1866, gave a local fund,
which was expended in the district in which it accrued, and
besides there were general appropriations for the support of
the Bureau, which were, in part, available for schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Ingle, writing of school affairs in the District in 1867
and 1868, says:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great aid was given at this period by the Freedmen’s
Bureau, which, not limiting its assistance to schools for primary
instruction, did much toward establishing Howard University,
in which no distinction was made on account of race,
color, or sex, though it had originally been intended for the
education of negro men alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The monograph of Edward Ingle on “The Negro in the
District of Columbia”—one of the valuable Johns Hopkins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>University Studies—gives such a full and easily accessible
account of the education of the negroes in the District, that it
is needless to enlarge the pages of this paper by a repetition
of what he has so satisfactorily done.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bureau found many schools in localities which had
been within the lines of the Union armies, and these, with the
others established by its agency, were placed under more systematic
supervision. In some States, schools were carried on
entirely by aid of the funds of the Bureau, but it had the
coöperation and assistance of various religious and benevolent
societies. On July 1, 1866, Mr. Alvord, Inspector of Schools
and Finances, reported 975 schools in fifteen States and the
District, 1,405 teachers, and 90,778 scholars. He mentioned
as worthy of note a change of sentiment among better classes
in regard to freedmen’s schools, and that the schools were
steadily gaining in numbers, attainments, and general influence.
On January 17, 1867, General Howard reports to the Secretary
of War $115,261.56 as used for schools, and the Quartermaster’s
Department as still rendering valuable help.
Education “was carried on vigorously during the year,” a
better feeling prevailing, and 150,000 freedmen and children
“occupied earnestly in the study of books.” The taxes, which
had been levied for schools in Louisiana, under the administration
of T. W. Conway, had been discontinued, but $500,000
were asked for schools and asylums. In 1867, the Government
appointed Generals Steedman and Fullerton as Inspectors,
and from General Howard’s vehement reply to their
report—which the War Department declines to permit an
inspection of—it appears that their criticisms were decidedly
unfavorable. Civilians in the Bureau were now displaced by
army officers. In July, 1869, Mr. Alvord mentions decided
progress in educational returns, increasing thirst for knowledge,
greater public favor, and the establishment of 39 training
schools for teachers, with 3,377 pupils. Four months later,
General Howard says “hostility to schools and teachers has
in great measure ceased.” He reported the cost of the Bureau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>at $13,029,816, and earnestly recommended “the national
legislature” to establish a general system of free schools,
“furnishing to all children of a suitable age such instruction
in the rudiments of learning as would fit them to discharge
intelligently the duties of free American citizens.” Solicitor
Whiting had previously recommended that the head of the
Freedmen’s Bureau should be a cabinet officer, but this was
not granted, and the Bureau was finally discontinued—its
affairs being transferred to the War Department by Act of
Congress, June 10, 1872. It is apparent from the reports of
Sprague, Assistant Commissioner in Florida, and of Alvord
in 1867 and 1870, that the agents of the Bureau sometimes
used their official position and influence for organizing the
freedmen for party politics and to control elections. A full
history of the Freedmen’s Bureau would furnish an interesting
chapter in negro education, but a report from Inspector
Shriver on October 3, 1873, says the Department has “no
means of verifying the amount of retained bounty fund;” and
on December 4, 1873, the Department complains of “the
incomplete and disordered condition of the records of the late
Bureau.” (See Ex. Doc. No. 10, 43d Con., 1st Ses., and Ho.
Mis. Doc. No. 87, 42d Con., 3d Ses.)</p>

<p class='c006'>A committee of investigation upon General Howard’s use
of the Bureau for his pecuniary aggrandizement were divided
in opinion, but a large majority exonerated him from censure
and commended him for the excellent performance of difficult
duties. An equally strong and unanimous verdict of approval
was rendered by a Court of Inquiry, General Sherman presiding,
which was convened under an Act of Congress, February
13, 1874.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. It has been stated that the Bureau was authorized to
act in coöperation with benevolent or religious societies in the
education of the negroes. A number of these organizations
had done good service before the establishment of the Bureau
and continued their work afterwards. The teachers earliest
in the field were from the American Missionary Association,
Western Freedmen’s Aid Commission, American Baptist
Home Mission Society, and the Society of Friends. After
the surrender of Vicksburg and the occupation of Natchez,
others were sent by the United Presbyterians, Reformed Presbyterians,
United Brethren in Christ, Northwestern Freedmen’s
Aid Commission, and the National Freedmen’s Aid
Association. The first colored school in Vicksburg was started
in 1863 by the United Brethren in the basement of a Methodist
church.</p>

<p class='c006'>The American Missionary Association was the chief body,
apart from the Government, in the great enterprise of meeting
the needs of the negroes. It did not relinquish its philanthropic
work because army officers and the Federal Government
were working along the same line. Up to 1866 its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>receipts were swollen by “the aid of the Free Will Baptists,
the Wesleyans, the Congregationalists, and friends in Great
Britain.” From Great Britain it is estimated that “a million
of dollars in money and clothing were contributed through
various channels for the freedmen.” The third decade of the
Association, 1867–1876, was a marked era in its financial
history. The Freedmen’s Bureau turned over a large sum,
which could be expended only in buildings. A congressional
report says that between December, 1866, and May, 1870, the
Association received $243,753.22. Since the Association took
on a more distinctive and separate denominational character,
because of the withdrawal of other denominations into organizations
of their own, it, along with its church work, has
prosecuted, with unabated energy and marked success, its
educational work among the negroes. It has now under its

<p class='c006'>Some of these schools are not specially for negroes. It
would be unjust not to give the Association much credit for
Atlanta University and for Hampton Normal and Industrial
Institute, which are not included in the above recapitulation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>as the latter stands easily first among all the institutions
designed for negro development, both for influence and usefulness.
During the war and for a time afterwards, the school
work of the Association was necessarily primary and transitional,
but it grew into larger proportions, with higher standards,
and its normal and industrial work deserves special
mention and commendation. From 1860 to October 1, 1893,
its expenditures in the South for freedmen, directly and indirectly,
including church extension as well as education, have
been $11,610,000.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. In 1866 was organized “The Freedmen’s Aid and
Southern Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.” Under
that compact, powerful, well-disciplined, enthusiastic organization,
more than $6,000,000 have been expended in the
work of education of negroes. Dr. Hartzell said, before the
World’s Congress in Chicago, that Wilberforce University, at
Xenia, Ohio, was established in 1857 as a college for colored
people, and “continues to be the chief educational centre of
African Methodism in the United States.” He reports, as
under various branches of Methodism, 65 institutions of learning
for colored people, 388 teachers, 10,100 students,
$1,905,150 of property, and $652,500 of endowment. Among
these is Meharry Medical College of high standard and excellent
discipline, with dental and pharmaceutical departments
as well as medical. Near 200 students have been graduated.
The School of Mechanic Arts in Central Tennessee
College, under the management of Professor Sedgwick, has a
fine outfit, and has turned out telescopes and other instruments,
which command a ready and remunerative market in
this and other countries.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. On April 16, 1862, slavery was abolished in the
District of Columbia. By November, 13,000 refugees had
collected at Washington, Alexandria, Hampton, and Norfolk.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Under an unparalleled exigency, instant action was necessary.
The lack of educational privileges led Christian societies to
engage in educational work, at least in the rudiments of
learning, for the benefit of these people, who were eager to
be instructed. Even where education had not previously
been a part of the functions of certain organizations, the
imperative need of the liberated left no option as to duty.
With the assistance of the Baptist Free Mission Society and
of the Baptist Home Mission Society, schools were established
in Alexandria as early as January 1, 1862, and were
multiplied through succeeding years. After Appomattox, the
Baptist Home Mission Society was formally and deliberately
committed to the education of the blacks, giving itself largely
to the training of teachers and preachers. In May, 1892,
the Society had, under its management, 24 schools with 216
instructors, 4,861 pupils, of whom 1,756 were preparing to
teach, school property worth $750,000 and endowment funds
of $156,000. Probably, not less than 50,000 have attended
the various schools. Since 1860, $2,451,859.65 have been
expended for the benefit of the negroes. The Superintendent
of Education says: “The aggregate amount appropriated for the
salaries of teachers from the time the Society commenced its work
until January, 1883, was:—District of Columbia, $59,243.57;
Virginia, $65,254.44; North Carolina, $41,788.90; South Carolina,
$29,683.71; Florida, $3,164.16; Georgia, $26,963.21;
Alabama, $4,960.37; Mississippi, $6,611.05; Louisiana,
$39,168.25; Texas, $2,272.18; Arkansas, $150; Tennessee,
$57,898.86; Kentucky, $1,092.54; Missouri, $300. The following
gives the aggregate amount appropriated for teachers
and for all other purposes such as land, buildings, etc.,
from January, 1883, to January, 1893:—District of Columbia,
$103,110.01; Virginia, $193,974.08; North Carolina,
$142,861.95; South Carolina, $137,157.79; Florida, $55,923.96;
Georgia, $314,061.48; Alabama, $35,405.86; Mississippi,
$86,019.70; Louisiana, $33,720.93; Texas, $131,225.27;
Arkansas, $13,206.20; Tennessee, $164,514.05;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Kentucky, $49,798.56; Missouri, $6,543.13. Until January,
1883, the appropriations for teachers and for lands,
buildings, etc., were kept as separate items. I have already
given the appropriations for the teachers up to that date.
For grounds and buildings, $421,119.50 were appropriated.”
In connection with the Spelman Seminary and the Male
School in Atlanta, there has been established, under intelligent
and discriminating rules, a first class training department for
teachers. A new commodious structure well adapted to the
purpose, costing $55,000, was opened in December. At
Spelman there is an admirable training school for nurses,
where the pupils have hospital practice. Shaw University
at Raleigh has the flourishing Leonard Medical School and
a well equipped pharmacy.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. The Presbyterian Church at the North, in May,
1865, adopted a deliverance in favor of special efforts in
behalf of the “lately enslaved African race.” From the
28th annual report of the Board of Missions for Freedmen,
it appears that, besides building churches, special exertions
have been put forth “in establishing parochial schools, in
planting academies and seminaries, in equipping and supporting
a large and growing university.” The report mentions
fifteen schools,—three in North Carolina, four in South
Carolina, three in Arkansas, and one in each of the States
of Texas, Mississippi, Virginia, Georgia, and Tennessee.
$1,280,000 have been spent. “In the high schools and
parochial schools, we have (May, 1893) 10,520 students
who are being daily moulded under Presbyterian educational
influence.” The United Presbyterian Church reports for
May, 1893, an enrollment in schools of 2,558. The Southern
Presbyterians have a Theological Seminary in Birmingham,
Alabama, which was first opened in Tuskaloosa in 1877.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. The Episcopal Church, through the Commission on
Church Work among the Colored People, during the seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>years of its existence, 1887–1893, has expended $272,068,
but the expenditure is fairly apportioned between ministerial
and teaching purposes. The schools are parochial “with an
element of industrial training,” and are located in Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama, but the
“Reports” do not give the number of teachers and scholars.
The Friends have some well conducted schools, notably the
Schofield in Aiken, South Carolina. They have sustained
over 100 schools and have spent $1,004,129. In the mission
work of the Roman Catholic Church among the negroes,
school work and church work are so blended that it has been
very difficult to make a clear separation. Schools exist in
Baltimore, Washington, and all the Southern States, but with
how many teachers and pupils and at what cost the Report of
the Commission for 1893 does not show. A few extracts are
given. “We need,” says one, “all the help possible to cope with
the Public Schools of Washington. In fact our school facilities
are poor, and, unless we can do something to invite children
to our Catholic Schools, many of them will lose their faith.”
Another person writes: “Next year we shall have to exert
all the influence in our power to hold our school. Within
two doors of our school a large public school building is
being erected; this new public school building will draw
pupils away from the Catholic School, unless the latter be
made equally efficient in its work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>X. On February 6, 1867, George Peabody gave to certain
gentlemen two million dollars in trust, to be used “for
the promotion and encouragement of intellectual, moral, or
industrial education among the young of the more destitute
portions of the Southwestern States of our Union.” This gift
embraced both races, and Dr. Barnas Sears was fortunately
selected as the General Agent, to whom was committed practically
the administration of the Trust. In his first report
he remarked that, in many of the cities aided by the Fund,
provision was made for the children of both races, but said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that, as the subject of making equal provision for the education
of both races was occupying public attention, he thought
it the safer and wiser course not to set up schools on a precarious
foundation, but to confine help to public schools and
make efforts in all suitable ways to improve or have established
State systems of education. Still, in some localities aid was
judiciously given, and the United States Superintendent of
Education for the negroes in North Carolina gave testimony
that but for the Peabody aid many of the colored schools
would be closed. “Our Superintendents have aided largely
in distributing the Peabody Fund in nearly all the States.”
“Great good has thereby been accomplished at very little
added expense.” The Peabody Fund bent its energies and
directed its policy towards securing the establishment of State
systems of education which should make adequate and permanent
provision for universal education. State authorities
would have more power and general influence than individuals,
or denominational or private corporations. They represent
the whole people, are held to a strict accountability, protect
“from the charge of sectarianism and from the liability of
being overreached by interested parties.” State systems,
besides, have a continuous life and are founded on the just
principle that property is taxable for the maintenance of
general education. The Fund now acts exclusively with
State systems, and continues support to the negroes more
efficiently through such agencies.</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. Congress, by land grants since 1860, has furnished
to the Southern States substantial aid in the work of Agricultural
and Mechanical education. On March 2, 1867, the
Bureau of Education was established for the collection and
diffusion of information. This limited sphere of work has
been so interpreted and cultivated that the Bureau, under its
able Commissioners, especially under the leadership of that
most accomplished American educator, Dr. W. T. Harris,
has become one of the most efficient and intelligent educational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>agencies on the continent. To the general survey of the
educational field and comparative exhibits of the position of
the United States and other enlightened countries, have been
added discussions by specialists, and papers on the various
phases of educational life, produced by the incorporation of
diverse races into our national life or citizenship. The Annual
Reports and Circulars of Information contain a vast mass of
facts and studies in reference to the colored people, and a digest
and collaboration of them would give the most complete history
that could be prepared.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bureau and the Peabody Education Fund have been
most helpful allies in making suggestions in relation to legislation
in school matters, and giving, in intelligible, practical
form, the experiences of other States, home and foreign, in
devising and perfecting educational systems. All the States
of the South, as soon as they recovered their governments, put
in operation systems of public schools which gave equal
opportunities and privileges to both races. It would be singularly
unjust not to consider the difficulties, social, political,
and pecuniary, which embarrassed the South in the efforts to
inaugurate free education. It required unusual heroism to
adapt to the new conditions, but she was equal in fidelity and
energy to what was demanded for the reconstruction of society
and civil institutions. The complete enfranchisement of the
negroes and their new political relations, as the result of the
war and the new amendments to the Constitution, necessitated
an entire reorganization of the systems of public education.
To realize what has been accomplished is difficult, at best—impossible,
unless we estimate sufficiently the obstacles and
compare the facilities of to-day with the ignorance and bondage
of a generation ago, when some statutes made it an indictable
offence to teach a slave or free person of color. Comparisons
with densely populated sections are misleading, for in the
South the sparseness and poverty of the population are almost
a preventive of good schools. Still the results have been
marvellous. Out of 448 cities in the United States, with a
population each of 8,000 and over, only 73 are in the South.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Of 28, with a population from 100,000 to 1,500,000, only 2
(St. Louis being excluded) are in the South. Of 96, with
a population between 25,000 and 100,000, 17 are in the
South. The urban population is comparatively small, and
agriculture is the chief occupation. Of 858,000 negroes in
Georgia, 130,000 are in cities and towns, and 728,000 in
the country; in Mississippi, urban colored population,
42,000, rural, 700,000; in South Carolina, urban, 74,000,
rural, 615,000; in North Carolina, urban, 66,000, against
498,000 rural; in Alabama, 65,000 against 613,000; in
Louisiana, 93,000 against 466,000. The schools for colored
children are maintained on an average 89.2 days in a year, and
for white children 98.6, but the preponderance of the white
over the black race, in towns and cities, helps in part to
explain the difference. While the colored population supplies
less than its due proportion of pupils to the public schools,
and the regularity of attendance is less than with the white,
yet the difference in length of school term in schools for white
and schools for black children is trifling. In the same grades
the wages of teachers are about the same. The annual State
school revenue is apportioned impartially among white and
black children, so much per capita to each child. In the
rural districts the colored people are dependent chiefly upon
the State apportionment, which is by law devoted mainly to
the payment of teachers’ salaries. Hence, the school-houses
and other conveniences in the country for the negroes are
inferior, but in the cities the appropriation for schools is general
and is allotted to white and colored, according to the
needs of each. A small proportion of the school fund comes
from colored sources. All the States do not discriminate
in assessments of taxable property, but in Georgia, where the
ownership is ascertained, the negroes returned in 1892
$14,869,575 of taxable property against $448,883,959 returned
by white owners. The amount of property listed for
taxation in North Carolina in 1891 was, by white citizens,
$234,109,568; by colored citizens, $8,018,446. To an inquiry
for official data, the auditor of the State of Virginia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>says: “The taxes collected in 1891 from white citizens were
$2,991,646.24, and from the colored, $163,175.67. The
amount paid for public schools for whites, $588,564.87; for
negroes, $309,364.15. Add $15,000 for Colored Normal and
$80,000 for colored lunatic asylum. Apportioning the criminal
expenses between the white and the colored people in the
ratio of convicts of each race received into the Penitentiary
in 1891, and it shows that the criminal expenses put upon
the State annually by the whites are $55,749.57 and by the
negroes $204,018.99.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the desire of the colored people for education the proof
is conclusive, and of their capacity to receive mental culture
there is not the shade of a reason to support an adverse
hypothesis. The Bureau of Education furnishes the following
suggestive table:</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1890–91 there were 79,962 white teachers and 24,150
colored. To the enrollment in common schools should be
added 30,000 colored children, who are in normal or secondary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>schools. The amount expended for education of negroes is
not stated separately, but Dr. W. T. Harris estimates that there
must have been nearly $75,000,000 expended by the Southern
States, in addition to what has been contributed by missionary
and philanthropic sources. In Virginia, North Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas,
and Arkansas, annual grants are made for the support of
colored normal and industrial schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>The negroes must rely very largely upon the public schools
for their education, and so they should. They are, and will
continue to be, the most efficient factors for uplifting the race.
The States, at immense sacrifice, with impartial liberality, have
taxed themselves for a population which contributes very little
to the State revenues, and nothing could be done more prejudicial
to the educational interests of the colored people than to indulge
in any hostility or indifference to, or neglect of, these free schools.
Denominations and individuals can do nothing more harmful
to the race than to foster opposition to the public schools.</p>

<p class='c005'>XII. A potential agency in enlightening public opinion and
in working out the problem of the education of the negro has
been the John F. Slater Fund. “In view of the apprehensions
felt by all thoughtful persons,” when the duties and
privileges of citizenship were suddenly thrust upon millions
of lately emancipated slaves, Mr. Slater conceived the purpose
of giving a large sum of money to their proper education.
After deliberate reflection and much conference, he selected a
Board of Trust and placed in their hands a million of dollars.
This unique gift, originating wholly with himself, and elaborated
in his own mind in most of its details, was for “the
uplifting of the lately emancipated population of the Southern
States and their posterity, by conferring on them the blessings
of Christian education.” “Not only for their own sake, but
also for the sake of our common country,” he sought to provide
“the means of such education as shall tend to make them
good men and good citizens,” associating the instruction of the
mind “with training in just notions of duty toward God and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>man, in the light of the Holy Scriptures.” Leaving to the
corporation the largest discretion and liberty, in the prosecution
of the general object, as described in his Letter of Trust,
he yet indicated as “lines of operation adapted to the condition
of things” the encouragement of “institutions as are
most effectually useful in promoting the training of teachers.”
The Trust was to be administered “in no partisan, sectional,
or sectarian spirit, but in the interest of a generous patriotism
and an enlightened Christian spirit.” Soon after organization
the Trustees expressed very strongly their judgment that the
scholars should be “trained in some manual occupation,
simultaneously with their mental and moral instruction,” and
aid was confined to such institutions as gave “instruction in
trades and other manual occupations,” that the pupils might
obtain an intelligent mastery of the indispensable elements of
industrial success. So repeated have been similar declarations
on the part of the Trustees and the General Agents that manual
training, or education in industries, may be regarded as
an unalterable policy; but only such institutions were to be
aided as were, “with good reason, believed to be on a permanent
basis.” Mr. Slater explained “Christian Education,”
as used in his Letter of Gift, to be teaching, “leavened with
a predominant and salutary Christian influence,” such as was
found in “the common school teaching of Massachusetts and
Connecticut,” and that there was “no need of limiting the
gifts of the Fund to denominational institutions.” Since the
first appropriation, near fifty different institutions have been
aided, in sums ranging from $500 to $5,000. As required by
the Founder, neither principal nor income is expended for
land or buildings. For a few years aid was given in buying
machinery or apparatus, but now the income is applied almost
exclusively to paying the salaries of teachers engaged in the normal
or industrial work. The number of aided institutions has
been lessened, with the view of concentrating and making more
effective the aid and of improving the instruction in normal and
industrial work. The table appended presents a summary of the
appropriations which have been made from year to year.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
